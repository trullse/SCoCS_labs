Lena woke up early in the morning feeling excited. She had been planning a surprise for her best friend's birthday for
weeks now, and today was finally the day. She got dressed, double-checked all her preparations, and headed out the door.

The sun was just starting to rise, casting a golden glow over the city. Lena couldn't help but smile as she walked,
feeling grateful for the peaceful moment...

Lena stepped inside a Mr. Robertson present shop. Mrs. Robertson wasn't here. Suddenly, girl finds out that Dr. Nielson
is here. He also looks for a present. "Dr. Nielson, what are you looking for?", - asked Mr. Robertson. And then after
short conversation doctor bought 3 lbs. of sweets. Lena also saw the note on owner's table with text: "Meeting on Mon.
is very important, don't forget about it!"

Finally, she arrived at her friend's apartment, ready to give her the best birthday surprise ever. She knocked on the
door and waited patiently. Is her friend at home?!

When her friend opened the door, Lena pulled out a big bouquet of balloons, a homemade cake, and a beautifully wrapped
gift. Her friend's face lit up with surprise and delight.

They spent the day together, laughing, eating cake, and catching up on each other's lives. It was the perfect
celebration of their friendship.

As the day drew to a close, Lena said goodbye to her friend, feeling happy and fulfilled. It was moments like these that
made all the hard work and planning worth it. She went to bed that night, feeling grateful for the joy that her friend
brought into her life.
