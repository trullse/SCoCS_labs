Lena woke up early in the morning feeling excited. She had been planning a surprise for her best friend's birthday for
weeks now, and today was finally the day. She got dressed, double-checked all her preparations, and headed out the door.

The sun was just starting to rise, casting a golden glow over the city. Lena couldn't help but smile as she walked,
feeling grateful for the peaceful moment...

Lena stepped inside a Mr. Robertson present shop. There were sweets, small presents, toys, etc. Mrs. Robertson wasn't
here. Suddenly, girl finds out that Dr. Nielson is here. He also looks for a present. "Dr. Nielson, what are you looking
for?", - asked A.A. Robertson. And then after short conversation doctor bought 3 lbs. of sweets. Lena also saw a note
on owner's table. She saw a Mon. writing on it.

Finally, she arrived at her friend's apartment, ready to give her the best birthday surprise ever. She knocked on the
door and waited patiently. Is her friend at home?!
